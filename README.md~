Chat API utilizing web sockets

This project utilizes web sockets to make a chat server. _express_ has been used as the _HTTP Server_ , _ws_ as the underlying 
module for implementing web sockets. A document database _Couchdb_ has been used with clack. The database functionality has been loosely
bound with clack, so another database module could be used easily.

To connect to _CouchDb_, I have written a module _CouchePipe_ and a simple HTTP client. Though I would soon publish the complete 
API, here is a few functionality to get you started!
